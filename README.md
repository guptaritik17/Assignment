# 🦷 Adaptive Image Preprocessing for IOPA X-rays

**Dobbe AI – Data Science Intern Assignment**

## 📌 Problem Understanding

The task addresses a real-world challenge faced by Dobbe AI: the quality inconsistency in Intraoral Periapical (IOPA) dental X-rays sourced from various clinics and imaging software. This inconsistency — in terms of brightness, contrast, sharpness, and noise — negatively impacts the performance of downstream AI diagnostic models.

**Goal**: Build an adaptive image preprocessing pipeline that automatically analyzes each X-ray and applies suitable preprocessing techniques to standardize image quality, making the data more reliable for AI-driven diagnosis.

## 🗂 Dataset Description

- **Type**: Simulated medical dataset
- **Formats**: DICOM (`.dcm`) and RVG files
- **Size**: ~20 images with diverse quality issues (dark, noisy, blurry, etc.)
- **Characteristics**: Variations in exposure, resolution, and noise levels emulate real-world clinical imaging conditions.

Each image was processed using both static and adaptive preprocessing pipelines, and metrics were computed to evaluate improvements.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 🔍 Image Quality Metrics

To objectively quantify image improvements, three metrics were used:

- **Brightness**: Measured as the mean pixel intensity
- **Contrast**: Standard deviation of pixel intensities
- **Sharpness**: Variance of the Laplacian filter output

### 🧱 Static Preprocessing Pipeline (Baseline)

The static pipeline applies the same sequence of preprocessing operations to every image, regardless of its condition. It is straightforward to implement but lacks the flexibility to handle varying image quality.

#### 🔧 Steps and Explanation

**1. Global Histogram Equalization**
- **Function**: `cv2.equalizeHist(img)`
- **Purpose**: Redistributes pixel intensities to improve global contrast
- **Limitation**: May over-flatten contrast in already well-lit images

**2. Gaussian Denoising**
- **Function**: `cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 1.0)`
- **Purpose**: Reduces high-frequency noise while preserving structure
- **Limitation**: May blur fine details, especially in clean images

**3. Fixed Kernel Sharpening**
- **Function**: `cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)`
- **Kernel**:
  ```python
  [[ 0, -1,  0],
   [-1,  5, -1],
   [ 0, -1,  0]]
  ```
- **Purpose**: Enhances edges uniformly
- **Limitation**: Can lead to over-sharpening or halo artifacts in already sharp or noisy images

#### ✅ Summary

- ✅ Easy to implement and fast
- ❌ Not suitable for mixed-quality datasets
- ❌ Can underperform on noisy, dark, or overly sharp images

### 🤖 Adaptive Preprocessing Pipeline (Heuristic-Based)

The adaptive pipeline dynamically adjusts preprocessing steps based on the image's initial characteristics. This makes it more robust across diverse image conditions.

#### 📈 Metrics Used for Adaptation

| Metric | How It's Used |
|--------|---------------|
| Contrast | Determines CLAHE clip limit |
| Noise | Controls non-local means denoising strength |
| Sharpness | Controls sharpening strength |

#### 🔧 Steps and Explanation

**1. Contrast Estimation**
- **Method**: `np.percentile(img, 99) - np.percentile(img, 1)`
- **Usage**: Guides CLAHE's `clipLimit`

**2. Noise Estimation**
- **Method**: Extract 8 patches from image corners/sides and compute standard deviation
- **Usage**: Controls `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising()` strength

**3. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**
- **Function**: `cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=..., tileGridSize=(8,8))`
- **Adaptivity**: Clip limit set between `1.0 – 3.0` based on contrast
- **Purpose**: Local contrast enhancement with over-amplification control

**4. Edge-Preserving Smoothing**
- **Function**: `cv2.bilateralFilter(...)`
- **Purpose**: Smooths noise while preserving edges and textures

**5. Non-local Means Denoising**
- **Function**: `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(...)`
- **Adaptivity**: Denoising strength scaled by estimated noise level

**6. Adaptive Sharpening**
- **Function**: `cv2.addWeighted(img_denoised, strength, gaussian, -(strength - 1), 0)`
- **Adaptive Sharpening Parameters**:
  ```python
  if sharpness < 20:    # Very low sharpness
      strength = 2.0
  elif sharpness < 50:  # Moderately low
      strength = 1.7
  elif sharpness < 100: # Medium sharpness
      strength = 1.1
  else:                 # Already sharp
      strength = 0.7
  ```
- **Purpose**: Enhances structure without overdoing it

#### ✅ Summary

- ✅ Handles each image based on its actual quality
- ✅ Prevents over-processing and under-enhancing
- ✅ Demonstrates stronger improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and visual quality

### 🏥 Clinical Relevance

Misaligned preprocessing can critically impact dental AI diagnostic accuracy:

**Impact on Pathology Detection:**

**Caries Detection:**
- **Over-sharpening**: Creates false high-contrast edges, leading to healthy enamel being misclassified as early caries (false positives)
- **Under-contrast enhancement**: Subtle demineralization zones become invisible, missing early-stage caries (false negatives)
- **Noise amplification**: Random pixel variations mimic the texture patterns of carious lesions

**Root Fracture Analysis:**
- **Excessive noise reduction**: Smooths out fine fracture lines, causing missed diagnoses of vertical root fractures
- **Inadequate contrast**: Hairline fractures blend with surrounding bone density, reducing detection sensitivity
- **Artifacts from poor denoising**: Create linear artifacts that mimic fracture patterns (false positives)

**Bone Loss Detection:**
- **Inconsistent brightness normalization**: Prevents accurate comparison of bone density across different regions
- **Over-processing**: Removes subtle trabecular patterns essential for early periodontitis detection
- **Poor edge preservation**: Blurs the critical lamina dura boundaries used for bone level assessment

**Specific Clinical Consequences:**

**False Positives (Over-treatment):**
- Unnecessary restorative procedures due to artifact-enhanced "lesions"
- Patient anxiety and increased treatment costs
- Loss of healthy tooth structure from preventable interventions

**False Negatives (Under-treatment):**
- Delayed diagnosis leading to disease progression
- More complex and expensive treatments required later
- Potential for systemic complications from untreated dental infections

**Standardization Benefits:**
- Consistent image quality enables reliable AI model performance across different imaging equipment
- Reduced inter-observer variability in AI-assisted diagnoses
- Improved training data quality for future model development
- Enhanced confidence in AI recommendations for clinical decision-making

**Quality Assurance Integration:**
- Preprocessing metrics can serve as quality gates before AI analysis
- Automated flagging of images requiring manual review
- Continuous monitoring of preprocessing effectiveness through downstream AI performance tracking
